            Ned Ireland grew up living at a small cabin at Big White Ski Resort in Kelowna , B.C. With the small community
            school at the mountain, Ned was able to ski every day through his elementary and junior high school years. <br /><br />
            His passion for ski racing started when he joined Nancy Greene at an early age. After entering in a few
            youth ski cross races, Ned decided this was it!  He joined  Alberta Ski Cross, commuting from Kelowna and
            started racing the NorAm circuit. <br /><br />
            In 2014, he was named to the Canadian Ski Cross Development team and finished second overall on the
            NorAm circuit. He was one of the top four Canadian juniors to be named to the World Junior Championship team
            in 2014 and again in 2015. <br /><br />
            2016 was a break out season for Ned where he was a top competitor in Europe with a 5th place win at the Europa
            cup and a 2nd place at the FIS in Orcieres, France. He was also a consistent competitor on the NorAm taking home
            the overall championship, consequently earning a spot at each World Cup event for the 2016/17 season. Placing a
            respectable 5th at Canadian National Champioships, Ned looks forward to vying for the top spot in the future. <br /><br />
            Ned is working hard every single day to ensure his success in the upcoming season and to prove he can be a top performer
            for Canada. His passion and drive to be the best has overcome injury and any small setbacks along the way.<br /><br />
